      <h1>Favorite Games as a Kid</h1>
      <p>The following games are ones that I really enjoyed playing when I was younger (though I still like playing them now)</p>
      <h2>Castle Crashers</h2>
      <img src="images/castleCrashers.avif" alt="Castle Crashers Art" width="750" height="400">
      <p>Castle Crashers is a 1-4 player game in which you play (initially) as a knight chasing after the big bad guy to get your king's princesses back. The game gets its name from the fact that you are literally crashing into other castles to steal the princesses back.</p>
      <h2>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</h2>
      <img src="images/mh4u.jpg" alt="Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate Art" width="750" height="400">
      <p>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is a 1-4 player game in which you, well, hunt monsters. The title says it all, but doesn't do it much justice. There's a great variety of monsters to take down, from small to the size of a scyscraper.</p>
